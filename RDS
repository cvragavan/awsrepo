Testing a Connection to an Amazon RDS DB Instance:

You can test your connection to a DB instance using common Linux or Windows tools.
From a Linux or Unix terminal, you can test the connection by typing the following (replace <DB-instance-endpoint> 
with the endpoint and <port> with the port of your DB instance):

nc -zv <DB-instance-endpoint> <port> 

For example, the following shows a sample command and the return value:

nc -zv postgresql1.c6c8mn7tsdgv0.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com 8299

  Connection to postgresql1.c6c8mn7tsdgv0.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com 8299 port [tcp/vvr-data] succeeded!

Windows users can use Telnet to test the connection to a DB instance. Note that Telnet actions are not supported other than for testing the connection.
If a connection is successful, the action returns no message. 
If a connection is not successful, you receive an error message such as the following:

C:\>telnet sg-postgresql1.c6c8mntzhgv0.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com 819

  Connecting To sg-postgresql1.c6c8mntzhgv0.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com...Could not open
  connection to the host, on port 819: Connect failed 

Describe the DB instance:
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance
