The quickest way to get started is to run the aws configure command:
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID: foo
AWS Secret Access Key: bar
Default region name [us-west-2]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json

Accessing Services With Global Endpoints
Some services such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) have a single, global endpoint rather than different endpoints for each region.
$ aws iam list-users
